        "\n",
        "*b)* For now we have only used the mean prediction and not the uncertainty that is also provided by the model. To properly quantify the uncertainty, we can generate samples from the conditional distribution and then compute the average value of the samples. This average value will be random since it is based on a random sample paths and it is possible to compute its mean and variance. Can you write the code that does so?\n",
        "\n",
        "*c)* (advanced) In this case, the distribution of the average values of the samples can be computed analytically using the linearity of the expectation and the covariance. Give it a shot if you want to!\n"
